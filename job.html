	<h2><p> Billiards</p>
	<p> Billiards is a sport of precision and class. I picked up on it while hanging out with my friends in a pub in my local hometown. I started out confused on the rules of how to play, and would normally just hit the cue balls aimlessly hoping to get them into the pockets. After playing a few games, I picked up on how to angle my shots better and the amount of force to apply with my cue. I started to take a real interest when one of my friends would play with me competitively and beat me constantly, so naturally I started to learn more and watch other players play and developed my own knack for the sport. After buying my own cue and going to the pub to practice often, I would be greated with the regulars there and we would play a lot of games. I appreciate billiards because the game itself is very casual and you can do a lot of other things like eat food and socialize while you're playing. </p>
	
	<h2><p> Skateboarding</p>
	<p> I picked up skateboarding in middle-school and have skated ever since. I haven't been able to skate a lot recently, but I still use a pennyboard, which is a type of skateboard to cruise around campus and get to places more efficiently. All of my close friends in highschool skateboarded and we would usually go to the park in Portland to skate afterschool. I have gone to multiple local skate events, but have not competed on a professional level. I watch a lot of professional skating and know some locals that are very good who I used to skate with. One of my favorite skate tricks is a tre flip (360 flip) which is a kick flip mixed with a 360 spin.<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKXFZknHhOM"> [Here is a video to show it] </a></p>
	
	
	<h2><p> Breakdancing</p>
	<p> Breakdancing is a sport I have been engaged in for a few years now. I started taking interest when I saw a street performer downtown and wanted to learn how to do these complex moves with your body. I learned most of my dance moves on the internet, as anyone would, and started practicing with my friends. I learned that breakdancing is a very, very hard sport, and some power moves such as the windmill and flare take years to master. I currently still dance and go to a few clubs and meetings where I get to watch professional bboys (breakdancers). </p>
	
	<h2><p> Lifting <p>
	<p> I started lifting my senior year of highschool because I wanted to gain size and strength. being only 135lbs, I was pretty skinny, so I decided to get a membership at my local gym and start weightlifting. I found that lifting was a great stress reliever and an outlet to school and work, so I became a regular. I saw some powerlifters online and grew an interest in powerlifting because those people were just lifting insane amounts of weight. Currently, I am prepping for my first power lifting meet next year. </p>
