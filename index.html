<th><P>I was born and raised in  Portland, Maine. I have one younger sister, four years apart. My ethnicity is Viet-American; I can speak Vietnamese and French fluently, and I have taken a few courses in Arabic. Language is a fun hobby to learn for me! Some of my other hobbies include breakdancing, skateboarding, billiards, and learning about automobiles.</p></th>

<tr>
<th><p>I started to take an interest in French in highschool, where I was required to take a language class. At first, I thought taking Spanish would be a little easier, but after being assigned to French 1, I really liked the connections between the words and how the French language is structered. I developed my understanding of the language really quick and advanced to AP French by my Senior year.</p></th>

<th> My interest in skateboarding took off early in middle-school, where a lot of my friends would also skate. I thought it was a fun sport because you didn't need any teammates or a lot of equipment,and you also did not did a specific place to play the sport. I also like being able to travel everywhere in a faster period of time.
<p> Skateboarding allowed me to grow more as an independent person, and acknowledge that there is a lot to learn in any discipline.</p></th>
